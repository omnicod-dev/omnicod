# OmniCod

**A terminal-native AI coding assistant built for the way developers actually work.**

```
❯ omnicod
```

OmniCod runs entirely in your terminal. No browser tabs, no Electron overhead, no clipboard
juggling between windows. You stay in the environment where you already write code, and the AI
meets you there — with full access to your files, shell, language servers, and running processes.

---

## Why OmniCod?

Most AI coding tools are built around a chat interface that happens to have a code block.
OmniCod is built around a **coding environment** that happens to have a chat interface.

**It understands your project before you say a word.**
OmniCod scans your repository on startup — framework, language, package manager, config files,
existing conventions — and injects that context into every request. You don't have to explain
that you're using Next.js with Tailwind and Drizzle. It already knows.

**It works with real tools, not simulated ones.**
Every file read, shell command, and code edit happens through a typed, permission-controlled
tool layer. Commands are classified as safe, warning, or dangerous before execution. Risky
executables run inside an isolated sandbox. You always know what's happening and why.

**It thinks in parallel, not in sequence.**
Long tasks — refactoring a module, writing a test suite, auditing security — are broken into
subtasks and distributed across a pool of specialized worker agents: code, review, test, docs,
performance, security, debug, analytics, explore. Results flow back into a shared context.

**It speaks your stack's language.**
218+ skills cover specific frameworks, tools, and patterns. A skill isn't a prompt template —
it's a structured context injection that shapes how the AI reasons about your particular
combination of technologies.

**It stays out of your way.**
The TUI is built on Ink (React for terminals). It renders cleanly, scrolls correctly, handles
wide output, and gets out of the way when you're not interacting with it. No flickering, no
full-screen takeovers.

**It exposes a local API.**
Every session is reachable over HTTP with bearer-token auth. Pipe output from scripts, drive
OmniCod from CI, or build your own tooling on top.

## Installation

### Compile from source (recommended)

Produces a single self-contained binary with the Bun runtime embedded — no runtime dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omnicod/omnicod
cd omnicod
bun install
bun run build

# Run
./dist/omnicod
```

### Global install via npm

```bash
npm install -g @omnicod/cli
omnicod
```

### Requirements

```bash
# Set your API key
omnicod /config set anthropic sk-ant-...

# Open a specific directory
omnicod --workdir ~/projects/myapp
```

## MCP Integration

OmniCod reads MCP server configuration from `.omnicod/mcp.json`, using the same format
as `claude_desktop_config.json`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

MCP tools appear alongside built-in tools and are subject to the same permission system.

---

## HTTP API

OmniCod exposes a REST/SSE API on `127.0.0.1:7777`. All endpoints except `/v1/health`
require bearer-token authentication.

```bash
# Read the auto-generated token
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.omnicod/server-token)

# Health check (no auth required)
curl http://localhost:7777/v1/health

# Create a session
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/v1/session \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-6"}'

# List sessions
curl http://localhost:7777/v1/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Send a message (SSE stream)
curl -N http://localhost:7777/v1/session/<id>/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"refactor the auth module"}'
```

The token is stored at `~/.omnicod/server-token` (mode 600) and regenerated if deleted.

---

## Configuration

OmniCod stores all configuration in `~/.omnicod/`:

```
~/.omnicod/
├── omnicod.db          # SQLite database (sessions, config, MCP servers)
├── server-token        # HTTP API bearer token (chmod 600)
└── todos.json          # Project-local task list (per working directory)
```

To set a default provider and model:

```bash
omnicod /config set default.provider anthropic
omnicod /config set default.model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

---

## Development

```bash
bun install              # install dependencies
bun run dev              # start in development mode (hot reload)
bun run test             # run all 131 tests
bun run typecheck        # TypeScript strict check (both packages)
bun run build            # compile to standalone binary → dist/omnicod
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
bun run test

# Core only
bun test packages/core/test/*.test.ts

# TUI only
bun test packages/cli/test/*.test.tsx

# Single file
bun test packages/core/test/classifier.test.ts
```

Test coverage includes: bash classifier, token counting, permission system, context compaction,
sandbox detection, agent pool, HTTP server auth, and TUI components (Spinner, Markdown,
StatusBar, StartupBanner).
