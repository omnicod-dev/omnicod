# Blueprint Skill — Mandatory Planning Gate

**Rule:** No implementation without a blueprint. This is the non-negotiable first step.

---

## 1. Task Classification

```
How complex is this?
├── 1 file, 1 concern, <30 min   → SIMPLE — no blueprint needed, proceed directly
├── 2-4 files, clear scope       → MEDIUM — quick blueprint (5 min)
└── 5+ files, multi-agent        → COMPLEX — full DAG blueprint required

If MEDIUM or COMPLEX → continue below
```

---

## 2. Blueprint Template

Fill this for every MEDIUM/COMPLEX task:

```markdown
## Blueprint: {task name}

### Goal
One sentence: what success looks like.

### Scope
- Files affected: [list]
- New dependencies: [list or none]
- Breaking changes: yes/no

### Phases

#### Phase 1: Research (parallel)
- [ ] Read existing code patterns
- [ ] Check for similar implementations
- [ ] Identify constraints

#### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Step A (depends on: nothing)
- [ ] Step B (depends on: A)
- [ ] Step C (depends on: A)

#### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript check clean
- [ ] Security: no new vulnerabilities
- [ ] Lint: no new warnings

### Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Breaking existing API | Medium | Add to existing, don't replace |
| Performance regression | Low | Benchmark before/after |

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All Phase 3 checks pass
- [ ] Deployed and verified in staging

Proceed? (Yes / Adjust)
```

## 3. DAG Format (Complex Tasks)

For multi-agent tasks, express dependencies explicitly:

```
task-001: researcher  — Investigate existing patterns     [depends: nothing]
task-002: architect   — Design component structure        [depends: 001]
task-003: frontend-ops — Implement UI                    [depends: 002]
task-004: style-arch  — Apply design tokens              [depends: 003]
task-005: qa-specialist — Write tests                    [depends: 002]  ← parallel with 003
task-006: security    — Review auth changes              [depends: 003]
task-007: docs-agent  — Update documentation             [depends: 003, 004]
```

Phases:
- **Phase 1** (parallel): 001
- **Phase 2** (parallel): 002
- **Phase 3** (parallel): 003, 005
- **Phase 4** (parallel): 004, 006
- **Phase 5**: 007

---

## 4. Risk Scoring

```
Risk score = Likelihood × Impact

Likelihood: Low=1, Medium=2, High=3
Impact:     Low=1, Medium=2, High=3

Score ≥ 6 → add explicit mitigation step to Phase 1
Score ≥ 8 → present to user before proceeding
```

---

## 5. Quick Blueprints (Common Tasks)

### New Feature
```
Phase 1: Read existing patterns, identify extension points
Phase 2: Implement (server) → implement (client) → connect
Phase 3: Unit test → integration test → lint → typecheck
```

### Bug Fix
```
Phase 1: Reproduce → identify root cause → find all affected locations
Phase 2: Fix root cause → update tests
Phase 3: Verify fix → check for regressions
```

### Refactor
```
Phase 1: Map all usages → identify safe extraction boundaries
Phase 2: Extract → update imports → verify types
Phase 3: All existing tests pass → no behavior change
```

### New API Endpoint
```
Phase 1: Design request/response shape → check auth requirements
Phase 2: Route handler → validation → business logic → tests
Phase 3: Security review → rate limiting → documentation
```

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Starting implementation immediately without stating the plan
✅ Always state the plan first, even for "simple" tasks

❌ Blueprinting in your head without writing it down
✅ Write the blueprint — it forces clarity and catches gaps

❌ Skipping Phase 3 (verification) because "it looks right"
✅ Verification is non-negotiable — it catches silent failures

❌ 10-step blueprints that cover everything
✅ Max 7 tasks per blueprint — split if larger
```

---

## Output Format

Always present blueprint as:

```
[BLUEPRINT] Task: {name}
Complexity: Simple / Medium / Complex
Phases: N | Agents: [list] | Estimated tasks: N

[Phase summary]

Proceed? (Yes / Adjust / Simplify)
```

- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
