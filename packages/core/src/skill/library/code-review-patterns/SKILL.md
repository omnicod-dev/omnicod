# Code Review Patterns

**Focus:** Quality, learning, collaboration, consistency

## 1. Review Checklist

```
Functionality:
├── Does it work as intended?
├── Edge cases handled?
├── Error handling present?
└── Security considerations?

Code Quality:
├── Readable, self-documenting?
├── DRY (no duplication)?
├── Single responsibility?
└── Tests included/updated?

Architecture:
├── Follows project patterns?
├── Appropriate complexity?
├── Dependencies correct?
└── Performance implications?
```

---

## 2. Feedback Types

```
Blocking (must fix):
├── Logic errors
├── Security vulnerabilities
├── Breaking changes
├── Missing tests

Non-blocking (suggestions):
├── Naming improvements
├── Code style
├── Documentation
└── Alternative approaches

Learning (optional):
├── Educational links
├── Interesting patterns
└── Design discussions
```

---

## 3. How to Give Feedback

```
Good patterns:
├── Ask questions, don't demand
├── Explain the why
├── Suggest alternatives
├── Praise good code
└── Be specific

Avoid:
├── Vague comments ("bad")
├── Personal attacks
├── Nitpicking style (use linter)
├── Late changes without notice
└── Long review delays
```

---

## 4. Review Process

```
Steps:
1. Author: Self-review first
2. Author: Add description/context
3. Reviewer: Read PR description
4. Reviewer: Run code, test behavior
5. Reviewer: Leave comments
6. Author: Address feedback
7. Reviewer: Approve/request changes
```

---

## 5. Approval Flow

```
Common patterns:
├── 1 approval required (small team)
├── 2 approvals (larger team)
├── Specific reviewers (architecture)
└── Auto-merge when approved

When to request changes:
├── Blocker issues
├── Unclear requirements
├── Missing context
└── Tests failing
```

---

## 6. Review Timing

```
Expectations:
├── Review within 24 hours
├── Smaller PRs faster to review
├── Block other work if urgent
└── Communicate delays

PR size: Keep < 400 lines
```

---

## 7. Author Responsibilities

```
Before PR:
├── Write good description
├── Self-review changes
├── Add tests
└── Run linter locally

After review:
├── Respond to comments
├── Don't take feedback personally
├── Ask for clarification if unclear
└── Update and re-request
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Be specific** - with examples
2. **Explain why** - not just what
3. **Ask vs demand** - questions work
4. **Small PRs** - faster review
5. **Timely** - within 24 hours

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Review style/formatting in PR comments
✅ Automate style with Prettier/ESLint — never manual style reviews

❌ "Looks good to me" on 800-line PRs
✅ PRs should be ≤400 lines; split if larger

❌ Review comments with no actionable suggestion
✅ Every comment either asks a question or suggests a specific fix

❌ Blocking PRs over personal preference, not bugs/correctness
✅ Distinguish nit (optional) vs blocker (must fix) in comments

❌ Author defending every line under review
✅ Code review is collaborative — be curious, not defensive
```

## Quick Reference

| What to review | Priority | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Correctness | Must | Logic errors, off-by-one |
| Security | Must | Auth checks, input validation |
| Performance | Should | N+1 queries, missing indexes |
| Tests | Should | Coverage, edge cases |
| Readability | Nice | Variable names, comments |
| Style | Automated | Prettier/ESLint, not humans |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
