# Data Pipeline Patterns

**Focus:** Designing robust, scalable, and maintainable data processing pipelines.

## 1. Pipeline Architectures

```
Architecture Styles:
├── Batch Processing
│   ├── Periodic processing of data in large chunks
│   ├── Use for: daily reports, historical analysis
│   └── Tools: Spark Batch, dbt, Pandas
│
├── Stream Processing
│   ├── Continuous processing of data as it arrives
│   ├── Use for: real-time alerts, live dashboards
│   └── Tools: Spark Streaming, Flink, Kafka Streams
│
└── Lambda Architecture
    ├── Batch layer (historical accuracy) + Speed layer (real-time)
    ├── Complex to maintain but robust
    └── Merged in a serving layer
```

---

## 2. Processing Frameworks

```
Framework Selection:
├── Pandas (Small/Medium Data)
│   ├── Single-node, memory-bound
│   ├── Excellent for EDA and simple transforms
│   └── Use: data < 1/4 of system RAM
│
├── Dask (Medium/Large Data)
│   ├── Distributed Pandas/NumPy
│   ├── Scales from laptop to cluster
│   └── Use: data > RAM, but still Python-centric
│
└── Apache Spark (Large Data)
    ├── Industry standard for distributed processing
    ├── JVM-based (PySpark for Python)
    └── Use: multi-terabyte datasets, complex joins
```

---

## 3. Transformation Patterns

```
Transformation logic:
├── Map/Reduce
│   ├── Map: apply function to each element
│   └── Reduce: aggregate elements together
│
├── Join Patterns
│   ├── Broadcast Join (small table + large table)
│   ├── Shuffle Hash Join (large + large)
│   └── Handling skew (salting keys)
│
├── Windowing
│   ├── Fixed windows (every 5 mins)
│   ├── Sliding windows (last 10 mins, every 1 min)
│   └── Session windows (based on activity)
│
└── Partitioning
    ├── Hive-style (year=2024/month=05/day=04)
    ├── Bucketing (hash-based distribution)
    └── Coalesce vs Repartition
```

---

## 4. Pipeline Reliability

```
Ensuring Data Integrity:
├── Idempotency
│   └── Rerunning the pipeline produces the same result
│   └── Use: overwrite partitions, not append
│
├── Checkpointing
│   └── Save progress to resume after failure
│
├── Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)
│   └── Store malformed data for manual inspection
│
└── Data Lineage
    └── Track where data came from and how it changed
```

---

## 5. Storage Formats

```
Columnar vs Row-based:
├── Parquet (Columnar) - Standard for OLAP
│   ├── High compression, efficient column reads
│   └── Schema embedded in file
│
├── Avro (Row-based) - Standard for Streaming
│   ├── Fast writes, schema evolution
│   └── Compact binary format
│
└── Delta / Iceberg / Hudi
    ├── ACID transactions on data lakes
    ├── Time travel (query historical versions)
    └── Schema enforcement and evolution
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Schema Enforcement** - Validate data against a schema at the entry point.
2. **Stateless Transformations** - Aim for pure functions to make testing and scaling easier.
3. **Lazy Evaluation** - Understand when computation actually happens (Spark/Dask).
4. **Data Quality Checks** - Use `Great Expectations` or custom validators between stages.
5. **Backfill Strategy** - Have a plan for re-processing historical data when logic changes.

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Loading everything into memory — OOM (Out of Memory) errors
✅ Use streaming or chunked processing (Pandas chunksize, Dask, Spark)

❌ Hardcoding paths and credentials
✅ Use environment variables and configuration files

❌ Missing monitoring — pipeline "succeeds" but produces no data
✅ Alert on empty outputs or unexpected record counts

❌ Using row-based formats (CSV/JSON) for large analytics
✅ Use Parquet or ORC for faster queries and lower storage costs

❌ No separation between raw, silver, and gold zones
✅ Follow the Medallion Architecture (Raw → Cleansed → Aggregated)
```

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Type | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Pandas | Batch | Small datasets, fast prototyping |
| Spark | Both | Large scale, enterprise pipelines |
| Dask | Both | Python-native scaling |
| Parquet | Storage | Analytical queries (OLAP) |
| Delta Lake | Storage | Reliable data lakes with ACID |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
