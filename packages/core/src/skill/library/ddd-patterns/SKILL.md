# Domain-Driven Design Patterns

**Focus:** Ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, domain modeling

## 1. Building Blocks

```
DDD Tactical Patterns:
├── Entities - identity, mutable
├── Value Objects - immutable, no identity
├── Aggregates - consistency boundary
├── Domain Services - stateless logic
├── Domain Events - something happened
├── Repositories - collection-like access
└── Factories - complex creation
```

---

## 2. Entity vs Value Object

```
Entity:
├── Has unique ID
├── Mutable state
├── Equality by ID
└── Example: User, Order, Product

Value Object:
├── No ID
├── Immutable
├── Equality by attributes
└── Example: Address, Money, Color
```

---

## 3. Aggregate Pattern

```
Aggregate Root:
├── Entry point for access
├── Enforces invariants
├── Controls changes
└── Example: Order (contains OrderItems)

Aggregate Rules:
├── One root per aggregate
├── Only root accessible from outside
├── Changes via root only
├── Consistency boundary
└── Transaction scope = aggregate
```

---

## 4. Bounded Context

```
What is a BC:
├── Explicit boundary
├── Own domain model
├── Own ubiquitous language
└── Own team ownership

How to identify:
├── Different domain vocabularies
├── Different team responsibilities
├── Different scaling needs
└── Different DB schemas
```

---

## 5. Domain Events

```
Event structure:
├── Unique ID
├── Occurred at timestamp
├── Event type name
├── Payload (what happened)

When to use:
├── Decouple components
├── Audit trail
├── CQRS read models
└── Event sourcing
```

---

## 6. When to Apply DDD

```
Apply DDD when:
├── Complex business domain
├── Ubiquitous language exists
├── Domain experts available
├── Long-term investment
└── Team understands patterns

Avoid when:
├── CRUD-heavy app
├── Simple domain
├── No domain expert
└── Tight timeline
```

---

## 7. Repository Pattern

```
Repository:
├── Collection metaphor
├── Methods: add, remove, getById
├── Query methods (find)
└── Implementation: DB or API

Interface in domain
Implementation in infrastructure
```

---

## 8. Service Layer vs Domain Service

```
Application Service:
├── Orchestrates use cases
├── Transaction management
├── Coordinates entities
└── Thin, declarative

Domain Service:
├── Pure business logic
├── Stateless
├── Between entities
└── When logic doesn't fit entity
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Aggregate** - transactional boundary
2. **Value Object** - immutable descriptors
3. **Bounded Context** - model boundary
4. **Ubiquitous Language** - shared vocabulary
5. **Domain Events** - decoupled communication

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Anemic domain model (entities are just data structs)
✅ Rich entities with behavior — User.changeEmail(), Order.place()

❌ Aggregate that spans too many entities
✅ Keep aggregates small; one transaction = one aggregate

❌ Domain events published synchronously blocking the caller
✅ Collect events in aggregate; dispatch after transaction commits

❌ Business logic in application services or controllers
✅ Logic belongs to entities and domain services

❌ Exposing aggregate internals to the outside
✅ Only aggregate root is accessible from outside; internal objects are private
```

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Role | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Entity | Identity + lifecycle | Mutable; identified by ID |
| Value Object | Describe by value | Immutable; no identity |
| Aggregate | Consistency boundary | One transaction per aggregate |
| Domain Event | Side effect trigger | Immutable; past tense name |
| Repository | Persistence facade | Returns full aggregates |
| Domain Service | Stateless logic | When logic doesn't fit entity |
| Bounded Context | Linguistic boundary | Each team owns its context |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
