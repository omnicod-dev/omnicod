# Documentation Patterns

**Focus:** Essential docs, maintainability, discoverability

## 1. What to Document

```
Must have:
├── Getting started guide
├── Architecture overview
├── API reference (if applicable)
├── Deployment steps
└── Troubleshooting

Should have:
├── Coding standards
├── Environment setup
├── Runbook for ops
└── Security considerations

Avoid:
├── Outdated docs
├── Obvious code comments
├── Duplicate information
└── Internal team quirks
```

---

## 2. README Structure

```
Standard README:
├── One-liner description
├── Quick start (3-5 steps)
├── Features overview
├── Prerequisites
├── Installation
├── Configuration
├── Usage examples
├── Testing
├── Deployment
├── Contributing
├── License

Keep under 100 lines, link details
```

---

## 3. API Documentation

```
Include:
├── Endpoint list (method, path)
├── Request format
├── Response format
├── Error codes
├── Authentication
├── Example requests/responses

Tools: OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman
```

---

## 4. Architecture Docs

```
Architecture decision:
├── System diagram
├── Component descriptions
├── Data flow
├── Technology choices
├── Rationale for decisions

Template: ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
```

---

## 5. When to Document

```
Write docs when:
├── New project starts
├── Onboarding new member
├── Complex logic added
├── New developer joins
└── Before you forget

Update docs when:
├── Requirements change
├── Breaking changes
└── Bugs found (add to troubleshooting)
```

---

## 6. Doc Maintenance

```
Keep docs fresh:
├── Treat docs like code (review)
├── Link from code where possible
├── Docs in same repo
├── Automate where possible
└── Remove stale content

If docs rot, remove them
```

---

## 7. Decision Trees

```
What to document:
├── If question asked twice → doc it
├── If setup takes > 5 steps → doc it
├── If error is non-obvious → doc it
└── If it's a rule → doc it

What not to document:
├── Obvious code behavior
├── Code comments are enough
├── Outdated content
└── Duplicate sources
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **README first** - essential start
2. **Code examples** - show usage
3. **Living docs** - keep updated
4. **ADRs** - record decisions
5. **Treat code** - version together

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Docs that describe WHAT the code does (code already shows that)
✅ Docs explain WHY decisions were made and non-obvious constraints

❌ Markdown docs that drift from the actual code
✅ Generate API docs from code (JSDoc, OpenAPI) — single source of truth

❌ README with installation but no usage examples
✅ README: install → quick start → common tasks → link to full docs

❌ Architecture diagrams stored as binary in git
✅ Diagrams as code (Mermaid, PlantUML) — diffable, versionable

❌ "Update docs later" — never happens
✅ Docs update in the same PR as the code change
```

## Quick Reference

| Doc type | Format | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| API reference | OpenAPI 3.1 | swagger-ui / redoc |
| Architecture | Mermaid diagram in MD | In-repo |
| Runbook | Numbered steps + checks | Confluence / Notion |
| ADR | Markdown with status | docs/decisions/ |
| README | Install → usage → contribute | Repo root |
| Inline | JSDoc with @param @returns | TypeDoc |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
