# Email Patterns

**Focus:** Delivery, templates, reliability

---

## 1. When to Use Email

```
When email is appropriate:

├── Transactional
    && Order confirmation
    && Password reset
    && Account notifications
│
├── Notifications
    && Alerts and monitoring
    && Scheduled reports
    && Activity digests
│
└── Marketing (with consent)
    └── Welcome series
    └── Product updates
    └── Opt-in required
```

```
When NOT to use email:

├── Real-time communication
    && Chat is better
    && Users expect instant
│
├── User-to-user messaging
    └── In-app messaging
    || Don't use email for this
│
└── Sensitive alerts
    && Security: in-app + push preferred
    && Don't rely on email alone
```

---

## 2. Email Service Selection

```
When to use what:

├── SendGrid/Mailgun/SES
    && Transactional email
    && Good deliverability
    && API-based
│
├── Postmark
    && Transactional focus
    && High deliverability
    && Good for startups
│
├── Mailchimp/Sendinblue
    && Marketing emphasis
    && Templates, campaigns
    && Less for transactional
│
└── Self-hosted (rarely)
    && Complete control
    && High cost, complexity
    && Only when needed
```

---

## 3. Template Strategy

```
When to use templates:

├── Template engine (SendGrid, Handlebars)
    && Dynamic content needed
    && Multiple email types
    && Non-technical can edit
│
├── Static HTML
    && Simple emails
    && No personalization
    || Lower flexibility
│
└── Code-generated
    && Complex logic
    && Full control
    && Harder to maintain
```

```
Template best practices:

├── Plain text version always
├── Responsive design (mobile)
├── Fallback fonts
├── Clear unsubscribe (required by law)
└── Physical address (required by law)
```

---

## 4. Delivery Reliability

```
How to ensure delivery:

├── Verification
    && SPF, DKIM, DMARC set up
    && Domain verified
    && Test with mail-tester.com
│
├── Error handling
    && Catch bounces
    && Suppress invalid emails
    && Track delivery status
│
├── Rate limiting
    && Respect provider limits
    && Batch sends
    && Exponential backoff on failure
│
└── Monitoring
    && Track open/click rates
    && Bounce rates
    && Deliverability issues
```

---

## 5. Feedback Loop

```
What to track:

├── Delivery metrics
    && Sent, delivered, bounced
    && By email type
│
├── Engagement
    && Open rate (with pixel tracking)
    && Click rate
    && Unsubscribe rate
│
├── Complaints
    && Spam reports
    && If high: review list quality
│
└── Time-based
    && Best send times
    && By user segment
```

```
When to act:

├── High bounce > 5%
    && Clean list
    || Verify addresses before send
│
├── Low engagement < 10% open
    && Review subject lines
    || Segment users differently
│
├── High complaints
    || Immediate list review
    || Consent verification
└── High unsubscribes
    || Too frequent?
    || Content not relevant?
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Transactional vs marketing** — Separate services, different rules
2. **Verify everything** — SPF/DKIM/DMARC
3. **Handle bounces** — Suppress invalid, track errors
4. **Monitor engagement** — Act on data
5. **Plain text fallback** — Always have

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Sending email synchronously inside HTTP request handler
✅ Queue email; deliver async via background worker

❌ Plain-text email only (no HTML template)
✅ Multipart emails: text/plain fallback + text/html styled

❌ Sending bulk email through SMTP directly
✅ Use transactional ESP (Resend, SendGrid, Postmark) for deliverability

❌ No unsubscribe link in marketing emails
✅ CAN-SPAM / GDPR: unsubscribe + physical address required

❌ Not testing email rendering across clients
✅ Litmus / Email on Acid preview before sending
```

## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
