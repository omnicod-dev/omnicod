# Event-Driven Architecture Patterns

**Focus:** Events, commands, event sourcing

---

## 1. When to Use Event-Driven

```
When event-driven makes sense:

├── Multiple subsystems need same data
│   └── Orders affect inventory, notifications, analytics
│   └── Each service owns its data
│
├── Loose coupling required
│   └── Services shouldn't call each other directly
│   └── Teams work independently
│
├── Real-time reactions needed
│   └── Notifications, dashboards, sync
│   └── Users see updates immediately
│
├── Audit trail important
│   └── Every change recorded
│   └── Replay for debugging
│
└── Scalability needed
    └── Handle burst traffic
    └── Decouple producers from consumers
```

```
When NOT to use:

├── Simple CRUD app
│   └── Direct database access is simpler
│
├── Strong consistency required
│   └── Eventual consistency issues
│   └── Use synchronous when can't lose data
│
├── Small team
│   └── Complexity overhead not worth it
│
└── Debugging difficult
    └── Hard to trace event chains
```

---

## 2. Event Patterns

```
Event types:

├── Domain events
    └── Something happened in domain
    └── Orders: OrderPlaced, OrderShipped
    └── Meaningful to business
│
├── Integration events
    └── Cross-service communication
    └── OrderPlaced → NotifyCustomer
    └── Technical, not business
│
└── Commands
    └── Intent to do something
    └── Expects response/action
    └── Not an event, a request
```

```
Event structure:
├── Event type: what happened
├── Payload: data about event
├── Metadata: timestamp, source, correlation ID
└── Event ID: unique identifier
```

---

## 3. Event Sourcing

```
When to use event sourcing:

├── Need complete audit trail
│   └── Every change stored as event
│   └── Can replay to any point
│
├── Complex state changes
│   └── State derived from event history
│   └── Shopping cart, workflow engines
│
├── Temporal queries
│   └── What was state at time T?
│   └── Reports, analytics, debugging
│
└── Long-running processes
    └── Saga, workflows
    └── Can resume from checkpoint
```

```
Challenges:
├── Learning curve for team
├── Event schema evolution (versioning)
├── Snapshotting for performance
└── Storage size over time
```

---

## 4. CQRS Pattern

```
When to use CQRS:

├── Read and write patterns differ
│   └── Writes: complex validation
│   └── Reads: multiple views, aggregations
│
├── Different scaling needs
│   └── Many more reads than writes
│   └── Scale read replicas independently
│
├── Multiple read models
│   └── Same data, different formats
│   └── Product: list view, detail view, admin view
│
└── Performance critical
    └── Optimized read paths
    └── Denormalized for queries
```

```
Implementation:
├── Write side: normalized model
├── Read side: optimized projections
├── Sync: events update read models
└── Eventually consistent
```

---

## 5. Choreography vs Orchestration

```
Choreography (decentralized):

├── Each service knows its job
│   └── Orders: emit OrderPlaced
│   └── Inventory: listens, updates stock
│   └── Notifications: listens, sends email
│
├── Pros: loose coupling, independent
├── Cons: hard to track flow, debugging
└── Use when: simple flows, few services
```

```
Orchestration (centralized):

├── Orchestrator directs the flow
│   └── OrderService coordinates
│   └── Calls Inventory, then Notifications
│
├── Pros: clear flow, easier debugging
├── Cons: orchestrator is bottleneck
└── Use when: complex flows, need control
```

---

## 6. Idempotency

```
Why idempotency matters:

├── Events can be delivered multiple times
├── Network failures cause retries
└── Must handle duplicate events

How to achieve:

├── Event ID tracking
    └── Store processed event IDs
    └── Skip if already processed
│
├── Natural idempotency
    └── Same input = same output
    └── "Set status to shipped" is idempotent
│
└── Deduplication table
    └── Store event ID + result
    └── Fast lookup for duplicates
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Events over direct calls** — Loose coupling
2. **Idempotent consumers** — Handle duplicates
3. **Version events** — Plan for schema changes
4. **Choreography for simple, orchestration for complex**
5. **CQRS when read/write patterns differ**

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Event consumers with direct coupling to producers
✅ Events via broker (Kafka/SNS/EventBridge) — producer never calls consumer

❌ Events with no schema contract (free-form JSON)
✅ Schema registry (Confluent/Glue) or Zod schema for every event type

❌ Event handlers that throw and cause infinite retry loops
✅ Bounded retry + dead letter queue; separate poison pill handling

❌ Choreography only — no visibility into multi-step workflows
✅ Add distributed tracing correlation ID across all event hops

❌ Mutable events — changing an event after publish
✅ Events are immutable facts in the past; append-only log
```

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | When | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| Choreography | Loose coupling, simple flows | Low |
| Orchestration | Complex workflows, visibility | Medium |
| Saga | Distributed transaction rollback | High |
| Event sourcing | Full audit trail | High |
| CQRS + events | Read/write separation | High |

| Broker | Throughput | Durability |
|---|---|---|
| Kafka | Very high | Durable replay |
| RabbitMQ | High | Configurable |
| SNS/SQS | High | Managed |
| EventBridge | Medium | Managed |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
