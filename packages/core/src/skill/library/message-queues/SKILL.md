# Message Queue Patterns

**Focus:** Async communication, reliability, scalability

---

## 1. Queue vs Pub/Sub

```
When to use Queue:

├── Point-to-point
│   └── One producer, one consumer (or competing consumers)
│   └── Example: processing orders, sending emails
│   └── Each message processed once
│
├── Task processing
│   └── Background jobs with workers
│   └── Rate limiting, load distribution
│   └── Example: image processing, report generation
│
└── Decoupling
    └── Producer doesn't need immediate response
    └── Different scaling requirements
```

```
When to use Pub/Sub:

├── Event broadcasting
    └── One publisher, multiple subscribers
    └── Example: notifications to multiple services
    └── Event-driven architecture
│
├── Fan-out patterns
│   └── Same message to multiple consumers
│   └── Example: analytics, logging, notifications
│
└── Independent components
    └── Services don't need to know about each other
    └── Loose coupling between services
```

---

## 2. Delivery Guarantees

```
At-least-once (most common):
├── Producer sends message
├── Consumer processes and acknowledges
├── If ack missing, message re-delivered
├── Risk: duplicate processing
├── Solution: idempotent consumers
└── Use when: duplicates OK, but no loss OK

At-most-once:
├── Send and forget, no ack needed
├── Risk: message loss
├── Use when: duplicates worse than loss
└── Example: metrics, telemetry
```

```
Exactly-once (rarely needed):
├── Too expensive for most use cases
├── Requires: transactional outbox pattern
├── Two-phase commit (expensive)
└── Use when: critical financial transactions
```

---

## 3. Ordering Guarantees

```
When to expect ordering:

├── Within partition (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
│   └── Messages in same queue/partition ordered
│   └── Use partition key to group related data
│   └── Example: same user events in order
│
├── No ordering (default)
│   └── Messages may arrive out of order
│   └── Consumer must handle reordering
│   └── Add sequence numbers or timestamps
│
└── Single consumer
    └── Only one consumer per queue
    └── Guarantees order
    └── Trade-off: no parallelism
```

---

## 4. Consumer Patterns

```
Competing consumers:
├── Multiple workers processing same queue
├── Each message processed by one worker
├── Use when: high throughput needed
├── Load balancing automatic
└── Example: background job processing

Fan-out consumer:
├── Each consumer gets all messages
├── Use when: multiple independent processing needed
└── Example: logging + analytics + notifications

Sequential consumer:
├── Single consumer, ordered processing
├── Use when: order matters
├── Trade-off: throughput limited
└── Example: state machine transitions
```

```
Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):
├── Failed messages after max retries
├── Inspect and reprocess manually
├── Prevent losing messages
└── Always configure DLQ for production
```

---

## 5. Message Design

```
What to include in messages:

├── Message ID
│   └── Unique identifier
│   └── For deduplication, tracing
│
├── Timestamp
│   └── When created
│   └── For ordering, TTL
│
├── Correlation ID
│   └── Links to original request
│   └── For tracing
│
├── Payload
│   └── Business data
│   └── Keep size reasonable (< 1MB)
│
└── Metadata
    └── Headers, routing info
    └── Avoid sensitive data
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Idempotent consumers** — Process same message multiple times safely
2. **DLQ for failures** — Never lose messages permanently
3. **Correlation IDs** — Trace messages through system
4. **Size limits** — Keep messages small (< 1MB)
5. **Backpressure** — Limit queue depth when consumers slow

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Fire-and-forget without acknowledging (message lost on crash)
✅ Explicit ack after successful processing; use dead letter queue

❌ Large payloads in queue messages (>256KB)
✅ Store payload in S3/DB; put reference ID in message

❌ No idempotency — processing same message twice causes duplicate
✅ Idempotency key per message; deduplicate before processing

❌ One queue for everything (low priority blocks high)
✅ Separate queues by priority; separate consumer groups

❌ No monitoring on queue depth
✅ Alert on queue depth > threshold and age > SLA
```

## Quick Reference

| System | Use case | Key feature |
|---|---|---|
| BullMQ (Redis) | Background jobs | Cron, retry, priority |
| RabbitMQ | Complex routing | Exchanges, topics |
| Kafka | Event streaming | High throughput, replay |
| SQS | AWS-native | Managed, DLQ built-in |
| Inngest | Serverless workflows | Step functions |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
