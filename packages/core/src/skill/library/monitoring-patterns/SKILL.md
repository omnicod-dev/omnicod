# Monitoring Patterns

**Focus:** System health, performance tracking, alerting philosophy

---

## 1. Metrics Strategy

```
What to monitor (USE method):

├── Utilization
│   ├── CPU, memory, disk usage
│   ├── Network bandwidth
│   └── Queue depths
│
├── Saturation
│   ├── How "full" resources are
│   ├── Request queue length
│   └── Connection pool usage
│
└── Errors
    ├── Error rate (errors per second)
    ├── HTTP 5xx ratio
    └── Exception count
```

```
Alternative approach (RED method):
├── Rate: requests per second
├── Errors: failed requests per second
└── Duration: latency distribution
```

---

## 2. Alerting Philosophy

```
When to create an alert:

├── Actionable
│   └── Can someone do something about it?
│   └── Alert fatigue comes from non-actionable alerts
│
├── Urgent
│   └── Does it need immediate attention?
│   └── Business impact: revenue, user experience
│
└── Observable
    └── Can you debug from the alert data?
    └── Include context: service, error, timeline
```

---

## 3. Alert Routing

```
Alert severity levels:

├── Critical (P1)
│   └── Immediate: phone call, SMS
│   └── Example: service down, data loss
│   └── SLA: respond in 15 minutes
│
├── Warning (P2)
│   └── Prompt: email, Slack
│   └── Example: high error rate, degraded performance
│   └── SLA: respond in 1 hour
│
├── Info (P3)
│   └── Dashboard only
│   └── Example: usage trends, capacity planning
│   └── SLA: respond in 24 hours
```

---

## 4. Observability Pillars

```
Three pillars (when to focus on each):

├── Logs
│   └── Use when: debugging specific requests
│   └── Store: structured, searchable format
│   └── Include: correlation IDs, timestamps
│
├── Metrics
│   └── Use when: trends over time, dashboards
│   └── Store: time-series database
│   └── Include: aggregations, percentiles
│
└── Traces
    └── Use when: distributed systems debugging
    └── Store: trace storage (Jaeger, Zipkin)
    └── Include: spans, timing, service map
```

---

## 5. Health Checks

```
Check types:

├── Liveness
│   └── Purpose: is process running?
│   └── Implementation: simple /health endpoint
│   └── Failure: restart container/pod
│
├── Readiness
│   └── Purpose: can handle requests?
│   └── Check: DB connection, downstream APIs
│   └── Failure: remove from load balancer
│
└── Startup
    └── Purpose: ready to receive traffic?
    └── Check: initialization complete
    └── Failure: timeout and restart
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **SLI over SLO over SLA** — Focus on measurable indicators first
2. **Burn rate** — Track error budget consumption
3. **Golden signals** — Latency, traffic, errors, saturation
4. **Alert on symptoms** — Not causes (e.g., "high latency" not "DB slow")
5. **Runbook required** — Every alert needs documented response

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Alert on every error — alert fatigue kills response
✅ Alert only on symptoms that affect users (SLO breach)

❌ Logs with no structure (free-text printf)
✅ Structured JSON logs with trace_id, user_id, severity

❌ Single dashboard with 50 panels nobody reads
✅ Service-level dashboards: one golden signals view per service

❌ No runbook linked to alert
✅ Every alert links to a runbook with diagnosis steps

❌ Monitoring added after incidents
✅ Define SLOs and add observability in the same PR as the feature
```

## Quick Reference

| Signal | Tool | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Latency | Histogram p95/p99 | > SLO threshold |
| Error rate | Counter / rate() | > 1% (5xx) |
| Saturation | CPU/memory gauge | > 80% sustained |
| Availability | Synthetic probe | < 99.9% (30d) |
| Business KPI | Custom counter | Domain-defined |
| Traces | Span duration | Outlier detection |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
