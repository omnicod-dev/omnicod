# Negotiation Simulator (Müzakere Uzmanı)

**Odak Alanı:** Satış müzakerelerini simüle etmek, fiyat müzakeresi stratejileri geliştirmek ve walk-away noktalarını belirlemek.

---

## Pattern 1: Fiyat Müzakere Stratejileri

### 1.1 Değer Odaklı Müzakere

```
Value Selling Framework:
├── Before Price Discussion
│   ├── Establish value clearly
│   ├── Quantify ROI
│   ├── Create urgency
│   └── Get commitment on value
│
├── When Price Comes Up
│   ├── Never discount without reason
│   ├── Trade value for price
│   ├── Always get something in return
│   └── Never be the first to give a number
│
└── After Initial Objection
    ├── Ask clarifying questions
    ├── Reframe value
    ├── Offer alternatives
    └── Create packaging options
```

### 1.2 Fiyat Müzakere Scripts

```
Script 1 - Value Anchoring:
"Let me share how [similar customer] calculated ROI: They saw [X% improvement] in [metric], which equals [dollar value] annually. With our price of $[X], that represents [X]% ROI. Does that framework make sense for your situation?"

Script 2 - Trade Value for Discount:
"I can certainly look at pricing options. To do that, I need to understand what you're trading. If we reduce price, what would you give up? [Features, timeline, support level, payment terms]. That way we find the right balance."

Script 3 - Price Objection Response:
"Before we discuss pricing specifics, help me understand: when you say [too expensive], are you comparing to [competitor], to your budget, or to expected ROI? Because I've found when we calculate actual value, the conversation changes."
```

### 1.3 Pricing Strategy Framework

```
Negotiation Tactics by Scenario:
├── Competitor Situation
│   ├── "They offer X, we offer Y. Here's the difference..."
│   ├── "Our [specific] is worth $X more than [competitor]..."
│   └── "Our pricing reflects [specific value]. What matters most to you?"
│
├── Budget Situation
│   ├── "Let's look at phased approach..."
│   ├── "What if we prioritized [critical features] first?"
│   └── "There's a [lower tier] option that fits..."
│
└── No Authority
    ├── "What's the process to get budget approved?"
    ├── "What information would help get approval?"
    └── "Can we present to the decision maker together?"
```

---

## Pattern 2: Value Selling Müzakere

### 2.1 Değer Çerçeveleme Teknikleri

```
Value Framework Tree:
├── Quantified Value
│   ├── Time saved × hourly rate
│   ├── Error reduction × cost per error
│   ├── Revenue increase × % attribution
│   └── Cost reduction × actual amount
│
├── Strategic Value
│   ├── Competitive advantage
│   ├── Risk reduction
│   ├── Customer satisfaction impact
│   └── Employee satisfaction
│
└── Emotional Value
    ├── Peace of mind
    ├── Reduced stress
    ├── Pride in work
    └── Career advancement
```

### 2.2 Value Selling Scripts

```
Script 1 - Cost of Inaction:
"What does it cost you to wait? You mentioned [problem] is costing [X]/month. A 3-month delay means [3X] in losses. Our price represents [X% of that]. The real question is: can you afford to wait?"

Script 2 - Value reframing:
"Instead of viewing this as [price], think of it as [investment]. [Similar company] invested [X] and got [Y] in return. The ratio is [Z:1]. What if we could demonstrate similar results for you?"

Script 3 - Feature Trade:
"I can offer a discount if we adjust scope. Option A: Full price, all features. Option B: [X]% discount, [removed feature]. Option C: [Y]% discount, [reduced support]. Which trade-off works for you?"
```

## Pattern 3: BATNA (En İyi Alternatif)

### 3.1 BATNA Kavramı ve Uygulama

```

│   ├── What are their alternatives?
│   ├── What happens if no deal?
│   ├── What's their timeline pressure?
│   └── What's their urgency?
│
└── How to Use
    ├── Never reveal your BATNA first
    ├── Understand their BATNA
    ├── Find zone of possible agreement
    └── Know your walk-away point
```

### 3.2 BATNA Discovery Questions

```
Questions to Identify Client BATNA:
├── Direct questions
│   ├── "What happens if we don't reach a deal?"
│   ├── "What's your timeline to solve this?"
│   ├── "What alternatives are you considering?"
│   └── "What would make this not worth pursuing?"
│
├── Contextual questions
│   ├── "Have you looked at [competitor]?"
│   ├── "What's your current solution costing you?"
│   ├── "When does your current contract end?"
│   └── "What other priorities are competing for budget?"
│
└── Pressure questions
│   ├── "How urgent is solving this problem?"
│   ├── "What would change if you had 6 more months?"
│   ├── "What's the cost of doing nothing?"
│   └── "What's driving the timeline?"
```

### 3.3 BATNA Response Strategy

```
Your BATNA Strength:
├── Strong BATNA
│   ├── "I understand you have options. Our unique value is..."
│   ├── "While [competitor] is an option, here's what makes us different..."
│   └── "The risk of [other option] is..."
│
├── Weak BATNA
│   ├── Focus on relationship value
│   ├── Highlight long-term benefits
│   ├── Offer flexibility on terms
│   └── Find non-price concessions
│
└── No BATNA
    ├── "We've found the best results come from..."
    ├── "Our customers say the biggest value is..."
    └── "Let me show you what success looks like..."
```

│
├── Hard Signal

```
