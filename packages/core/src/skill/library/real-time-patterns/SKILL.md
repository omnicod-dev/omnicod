# Real-Time Patterns

**Focus:** Choosing real-time strategy, implementation patterns, scaling

## 1. Protocol Decision Tree

```
Use WebSockets when:
├── Bidirectional communication needed
├── Low-latency updates (chat, games)
├── High frequency messages
└── State synchronization

Use SSE when:
├── Server-to-client only
├── Simple one-way updates
├── Works with HTTP/2
└── Firewall-friendly

Use Polling when:
├── Infrequent updates
├── Simple implementation
├── No server state needed
└── Budget constraints
```

---

## 2. WebSocket Patterns

```
Connection lifecycle:
├── Handshake: HTTP upgrade
├── Connected: persistent
├── Ping/Pong: keep-alive
└── Close: graceful or error

Message patterns:
├── Text: JSON payloads
├── Binary: protocol buffers
└── Control frames: ping, pong, close

Scaling:
├── Sticky sessions or Redis pub/sub
├── Message brokers (Redis, Kafka)
└── Horizontal scaling
```

---

## 3. Room/Channel Patterns

```
Room structure:
├── userId + roomId: private chat
├── roomId only: group channel
└── projectId: collaborative doc

Implementation:
├── Map roomId to subscriber set
├── Pub/sub to room channels
└── Add/remove on join/leave

State management:
├── In-memory: fast, single instance
├── Redis: distributed, persistent
└── Database: slow, last resort
```

---

## 4. Presence Patterns

```
Presence tracking:
├── Online/offline status
├── Last seen timestamp
├── Currently viewing (optional)

Implementation:
├── Heartbeat: every 30-60s
├── Expire: 2-3x heartbeat
└── Broadcast on join/leave

Use cases:
├── Show "user is typing"
├── Online indicators
└── Active user list
```

---

## 5. Reconnection Patterns

```
Reconnection strategy:
├── Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 32s max
├── Max retries: 5-10 then give up
└── User notification after max

State recovery:
├── Replay missed messages (with cursor)
├── Full state refetch
└── Optimistic UI, reconcile

Edge cases:
├── Network switch (wifi/cellular)
├── Sleep/wake
└── Tab backgrounding
```

---

## 6. Message Delivery Patterns

```
Delivery guarantees:
├── At-most-once: fire and forget
├── At-least-once: ack + retry
└── Exactly-once: complex, rarely needed

Implementation:
├── Sequence numbers
├── Client ack
└── Server retry until ack

Offline queue:
├── Queue locally while disconnected
├── Sync on reconnect
└── Handle conflicts
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **WebSockets for bidirectional** - Games, chat
2. **SSE for server push** - Notifications, feeds
3. **Polling for simplicity** - Low frequency
4. **Heartbeat for presence** - 30-60s intervals
5. **Exponential backoff** - Reconnection
6. **Message acks** - Reliability over UDP

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Polling every second from client
✅ Server-Sent Events for server→client; WebSocket for bidirectional

❌ Broadcasting every event to every connected client
✅ Room/channel-based routing — clients subscribe to relevant streams

❌ No backpressure handling on fast publishers
✅ Implement flow control; drop/buffer when consumer is slow

❌ Storing real-time state only in memory (lost on restart)
✅ Persist to Redis / DB; reconnecting clients can catch up

❌ WebSocket without heartbeat/ping-pong
✅ Send heartbeat every 30s; disconnect silent clients
```

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Transport | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| Chat / collaboration | WebSocket | Bidirectional |
| Notifications | SSE | Server→client only |
| Live dashboards | SSE | Server→client only |
| Game state | WebSocket | Low latency |
| Presence | WebSocket + Redis | User online/offline |
| Event stream | Kafka / Redis Streams | Durable replay |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
