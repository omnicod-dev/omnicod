│   ├── Yes → "Perfect. I wanted to follow up to understand your priorities..."
│   └── No → "No worries. Let me give you a quick overview of why I reached out..."
├── Busy response → "I completely understand. Let me take just 2 minutes, then I'll get out of your hair."
└── Skeptical response → "I appreciate your skepticism. Let me be direct: I think [specific value] could help with [their specific challenge]."
```

### 1.2 Discovery Question Framework

## Pattern 2: Presentation Scriptleri

### 2.1 Demo/Presentation Opening

```
Demo Opening Script:
"Hi [Name], thanks for making time today. Before we start—I'm curious: what's your main goal for our conversation today? [Listen]. Perfect. So I'll be showing you how we help [achieve that goal]. I'll pause along the way for questions. Sound good?"

Presentation Framework:
├── Hook (2 min)
│   ├── "Based on what you told me about [pain point]..."
│   ├── "Here's what I'm going to show you..."
│   └── "By the end, you'll know if [solution] makes sense..."

    └── "ROI calculation showed [X]%"
```

## Pattern 3: Closing Scripts

### 3.1 Trial Close Techniques

```
Mid-Conversation Closes:
├── Agreement Close
│   ├── "That makes sense, right?"
│   ├── "Would you agree that...?"
│   └── "Does that solve the [problem]?"
│
├── Summary Close
│   ├── "So to recap, we've covered [X, Y, Z]..."
│   ├── "The key takeaways are [X and Y]..."
│   └── "Does that align with your priorities?"
│
└── Mini-Close
    ├── "How does that approach sound?"
    ├── "Does that address your concern?"
    └── "Is that the kind of result you're looking for?"
```

### 3.2 Direct Close Scripts

```
Trial Offer Close:
"Based on everything we've discussed, I think the best next step is to try [product/service] with [specific scope]. This gives you [specific benefit]. What do you think?"

Meeting Booking Close:
"I've enjoyed our conversation. I'd love to continue this with [specific format: demo/presentation/workshop]. What's your availability next week?"

Decision Close:
"We've covered a lot today. I think [solution] could really help with [their goal]. Are you ready to move forward, or is there anything else you need to make a decision?"
```

### 3.3 Handling "Need to Think" Close

```
Response Script:
"Completely understand. When you say 'need to think about it,' can you help me understand what specifically you're thinking through?"

Common answers and responses:
├── "Need to discuss with team"
│   └── "Who else is involved? Can we include them?"
├── "Need to compare options"
│   └── "What are you comparing against? Can I help with that?"
├── "Need more information"
│   └── "What information would help? Let me address that."
└── "Not ready to commit"
│   └── "What would need to happen to feel ready?"
```

---

## Pattern 4: Objection Response Scripts

### 4.1 Common Objection Scripts

```
Price: "It's too expensive"
Response: "I hear you. Let me ask: when you say too expensive, are you comparing to [competitor] or to your current manual process? Because the ROI shows [X]% return within [timeframe]."

Timing: "Not the right time"
Response: "What changes in [timeframe]? [Listen]. И если я правильно понял, [repeat reason]. What if we could start with a small pilot that won't take much time?"

Competition: "We're going with [Competitor]"
Response: "Congrats on choosing a solution. Curious—what sealed the deal for them? [Listen]. The main difference with us is [key differentiation]. Is there anything you wish they had that we could offer?"
```

### 4.2 Objection Framework Template

```
Universal Response:
1. Acknowledge: "I understand why that's important..."
2. Clarify: "When you say [objection], can you tell me more about...?"
3. Respond: "Based on what you've shared... [specific answer]"
4. Confirm: "Does that address your concern?"
5. Progress: "So what's the next step?"
```

## Pattern 5: Follow-Up Scripts

### 5.1 Post-Meeting Scripts

```
Same Day Follow-Up:
"Hi [Name], great meeting you today. Quick recap: [summary of key points]. Next steps: [specific action]. I'll send [item] by [time]. Questions in the meantime, just reply to this. Talk soon!"

48-Hour Follow-Up (No response):
"Hi [Name], following up on our conversation. I know you're busy—wanted to make sure you saw this. [Send relevant article/content based on discussion]. Quick question: do you have 5 minutes this week to discuss [next step]?"

Meeting Request Follow-Up:
"Hi [Name], I know we spoke last week about [topic]. I wanted to follow up because [specific reason: new content, relevant news, timing]. Would [specific date/time] work for a quick call?"
```

### 5.2 Voicemail Scripts

```
Effective Voicemail:
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. [One specific reason for call—NOT "just following up"]. My number is [number]. I'm available [times]. Looking forward to connecting. Thanks!"

Follow-up Voicemail:
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] again. Quick update: [reason to call—new info, relevant content]. Wanted to catch you before [deadline/reason]. My number is [number]. Talk soon."
```
