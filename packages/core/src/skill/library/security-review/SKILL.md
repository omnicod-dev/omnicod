# Security Architecture Patterns

**Focus:** OWASP Top 10, threat patterns, best practices

## 1. Input Validation Strategy

```
What to validate:
├── ALL user input (never trust client)
├── API parameters (even from "internal" sources)
├── File uploads (type, size, name)
└── Third-party webhooks (verify signature)

Where to validate:
├── Schema validation: at API boundary (Zod)
├── Business logic: in domain/service layer
└── Database: constraints (unique, foreign key)

Pattern:
1. Validate schema at boundary (early failure)
2. Validate business rules in service
3. Let DB enforce constraints
```

---

## 2. Authentication Patterns

```
How to handle auth?
├── Session-based: server stores session, cookie on client
│   └── Good for: server-rendered apps, simple
│
├── JWT: self-contained tokens
│   └── Good for: APIs, SPAs, mobile
│   └── Store in httpOnly cookie or Authorization header
│
└── OAuth/SSO: third-party identity
    └── Good for: social login, enterprise
```

**Password handling:**
- NEVER store plain text
- Use Argon2id or bcrypt (not MD5/SHA)
- Never send passwords in URLs or logs

---

## 3. Authorization Patterns

```
Authorization levels:
├── Authentication: WHO is this? (logged in?)
├── Authorization: WHAT can they do? (permissions)
└── Resource ownership: CAN they access THIS? (ownership)

Implementation:
├── Role-based (RBAC): simple, fixed roles
│   └── user, admin, moderator
│
├── Permission-based: granular
│   └── user.can('read') .can('write') .can('delete')
│
└── Resource-based: ownership check
    └── userId === resource.ownerId
```

---

## 4. SQL Injection Prevention

```
When to worry:
├── Any raw SQL query
├── Any string concatenated into SQL
└── User input in database queries

Pattern:
├── Parameterized queries (Prisma does this automatically)
├── ORM for most queries
├── Raw SQL only when ORM insufficient
└── NEVER: string interpolation into SQL
```

---

## 5. XSS Prevention

```
When to worry:
├── User input rendered as HTML
├── User input in JavaScript
└── User input in URLs

Defense layers:
├── 1. Escape all output (React does this by default)
├── 2. Sanitize HTML if needed (DOMPurify for rich text)
├── 3. Content Security Policy (CSP headers)
├── 4. httpOnly cookies (no XSS access to tokens)
└── 5. Input validation (reject known bad)
```

---

## 6. Secrets Management

```
What is a secret:
├── API keys, tokens, passwords
├── Database connection strings
├── Encryption keys
└── Third-party credentials

Pattern:
├── NEVER commit secrets to git
├── Use environment variables (or secret manager)
├── Validate at startup (fail fast if missing)
├── Different secrets per environment
└── Rotate secrets regularly
```

---

## 7. Rate Limiting Strategy

```
When to implement:
├── Public APIs
├── Login/registration endpoints
├── Search/exensive operations
└── Any resource-limited operation

How to implement:
├── IP-based for general limits
├── User-based for authenticated endpoints
├── Exponential backoff for retry
└── Return proper status (429) + Retry-After
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Validate at boundary** - Fail fast, don't trust inputs
2. **Parameterized queries** - Never string-concatenate SQL
3. **Authenticate + authorize** - Both needed, different purposes
4. **Secrets in env** - Never in code
5. **Rate limit public** - Prevent abuse

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Trust user input inside SQL/shell strings
✅ Parameterized queries always; never string-concatenate SQL

❌ Sensitive data in URL query parameters
✅ POST body for sensitive data; never tokens/passwords in URLs

❌ JWT with alg: none or HS256 with weak secret
✅ RS256/ES256 for JWTs; rotate keys; verify signature server-side

❌ Storing plaintext passwords
✅ bcrypt (cost 12+) or Argon2id — never reversible encryption

❌ CORS * in production
✅ Explicit allowlist of origins; never wildcard with credentials
```

## Quick Reference

| Threat | Mitigation | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| SQLi | Parameterized queries | Critical |
| XSS | CSP + sanitize output | Critical |
| Auth bypass | Verify JWT server-side | Critical |
| CSRF | SameSite=Strict cookie | High |
| Path traversal | Validate + normalize paths | High |
| Rate limiting | Redis sliding window | High |
| Secrets exposure | Vault / env injection | Critical |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
