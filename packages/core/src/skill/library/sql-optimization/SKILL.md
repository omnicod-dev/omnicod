# SQL Optimization Patterns

**Focus:** Query performance, execution plans, indexing, JOIN optimization

## 1. Execution Plan Analysis

```
Reading EXPLAIN Output:

PostgreSQL:
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT TEXT) SELECT ...

Key Metrics:
├── seq scan    → Full table scan (bad for large tables)
├── index scan  → Using index (good)
├── index only scan → Covering index, no table lookup (best)
├── bitmap      → Using bitmap for large datasets
├── nested loop → Potentially slow for large tables
├── hash join   → Good for large datasets
└── sort        → In-memory vs disk sort

Seq Scan vs Index Scan:
├── < 1000 rows → Seq scan often faster
├── > 10000 rows → Index scan preferred
├── < 1% of rows → Index beneficial
└── = 100% of rows → Seq scan inevitable

Cost Interpretation:
├── cost=0.00..1.00 → Startup cost
├── cost=1.00..100.00 → Total cost
└── Lower is better
```

## 2. Indexing Strategies

```
When to Index:
├── WHERE clause columns → Always index
├── JOIN columns → Always index
├── ORDER BY columns → Consider index for large sorts
├── GROUP BY columns → Consider index
└── Columns with high cardinality → Best for B-tree

Composite Indexes:
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email_status ON users(email, status);

Index Column Order:
├── Put high-cardinality columns first
├── Put equality conditions first
├── Put range conditions last
└── Consider query patterns, not table schema

Covering Index:
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email) INCLUDE (name, created_at);

Index Types:
├── B-tree → Default, for equality and range
├── Hash → Exact match only, memory-based
├── GIN → Full-text search, arrays, JSONB
├── BRIN → Time-series, append-only data
└── GiST → Geospatial, range types

Index Maintenance:
├── Monitor index usage: pg_stat_user_indexes
├── Remove unused indexes → Saves write overhead
├── Index bloat → Monitor and REINDEX periodically
└── Partial indexes → For filtered queries
```

## 3. Query Optimization Patterns

```
SELECT Optimization:
❌ SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
✅ SELECT id, email, name FROM users WHERE id = 1;

❌ SELECT DISTINCT... (often slow)
✅ Use GROUP BY with aggregation instead

❌ SELECT MAX(id) + 1 (generate IDs)
✅ Use sequences or auto-increment

Join Optimization:
❌ Multiple N+1 queries in loop
✅ Single query with JOIN or subquery

❌ SELECT * FROM orders JOIN users
✅ SELECT o.id, o.total, u.email FROM orders o JOIN users u ON ...

Subqueries vs JOINs:
├── Subquery for filtering → Use IN/EXISTS
├── Subquery for calculation → Use JOIN or CTE
├── Correlated subqueries → Often slow, rewrite to JOIN
└── CTE (WITH) → Better readability, can be materialized

LIMIT Optimization:
❌ SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 (full sort)
✅ SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM users)

✅ Use cursor pagination: WHERE id > last_id LIMIT 20
```

---

## 4. Pagination Patterns

```
Offset-based (Problematic for large offsets):
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 20 OFFSET 100000;

Problems:
├── Must scan 100,020 rows
├── Slow on high offsets
├── Inconsistent with concurrent writes

Cursor-based (Recommended):
-- First page
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;

-- Next page (use last item's created_at)
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE created_at < '2024-01-15 10:30:00'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;

Keyset Pagination:
-- More efficient than timestamp
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 1000 ORDER BY id LIMIT 20;

Limit with Subquery:
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 20 OFFSET 1000
) AS page ORDER BY created_at;

Window Functions (Counts):
SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER() as total_count FROM users;
-- Add total_count to know total without second query
```

---

## 5. Common Performance Anti-Patterns

```
N+1 Query Problem:
❌
for (const user of users) {
  const posts = db.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = ?', user.id)
}

✅
const posts = await db.query(
  'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id IN (?)',
  users.map(u => u.id)
)

SELECT in INSERT:
❌
for (const item of items) {
  await db.insert('logs', { ...item })
}

✅
await db.insert('logs', items)  // Bulk insert
-- or
await db.query('INSERT INTO logs VALUES (?, ?), (?, ?), ...', flattened)

Functions in WHERE:
❌ SELECT * FROM users WHERE LOWER(email) = 'test@test.com'
✅ SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@test.com' (with index)
-- Use expression index if needed

Date Functions on Columns:
❌ SELECT * FROM logs WHERE DATE(created_at) = '2024-01-15'
✅ SELECT * FROM logs WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-15' AND created_at < '2024-01-16'
✅ CREATE INDEX idx_logs_date ON logs (DATE(created_at)) -- using generated column

LIKE Leading Wildcard:
❌ SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%john%'
✅ Use full-text search (GIN index)
✅ If prefix search: name LIKE 'john%' (can use index)
```

## 6. Query Analysis Checklist

```
Before Writing Any Query:
├── Do you need all columns? Select specific ones
├── Can you add WHERE clause to reduce rows?
├── Are there proper indexes on WHERE columns?
├── Is JOIN order optimal? Small table first
└── Can you use LIMIT?

Monitoring Queries:
├── Enable slow query log (long_query_time = 1)
├── Use pg_stat_statements (PostgreSQL)
├── Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for problematic queries
├── Monitor wait events
└── Track query patterns over time

Query Performance Metrics:
├── Response time < 100ms (good)
├── Response time 100-500ms (acceptable)
├── Response time > 1s (needs optimization)
└── Response time > 5s (critical)

Scaling Strategies:
├── Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
├── Connection pooling (pgBouncer)
├── Query result caching (Redis)
├── Partitioning for time-series
└── Consider denormalization for read-heavy
```

## 7. Database-Specific Tips

```
PostgreSQL:
├── pg_stat_activity → Current queries
├── pg_indexes → List all indexes
├── EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) → Detailed analysis
├── pg_trgm extension → Trigram index for LIKE
├── Partial indexes → Index filtered subsets
└── Materialized views → Pre-computed results

MySQL:
├── EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON → Detailed plan
├── SHOW INDEXES FROM table → List indexes
├── optimizer_trace → Deep optimization insights
├── Use FORCE INDEX when optimizer is wrong
└── InnoDB buffer pool warm-up

SQL Server:
├── SET STATISTICS IO ON → IO details
├── SET STATISTICS TIME ON → Execution time
├── Include actual execution plan
├── Missing index DMVs → Index recommendations
└── Query store → Historical performance
```

## Key Patterns

1. **EXPLAIN first** — Always analyze query plan before optimizing
2. **Index strategically** — Focus on WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY columns
3. **Avoid SELECT *** — Select only needed columns
4. **Use cursor pagination** — Never use OFFSET for large datasets
5. **Batch operations** — Bulk inserts, avoid N+1 queries
6. **Monitor continuously** — Slow query logs, query statistics

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ SELECT * FROM table (fetches all columns)
✅ SELECT id, name, email FROM table

❌ SELECT * FROM users WHERE LOWER(email) = 'x'
✅ Use case-insensitive index or COLLATE

❌ SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (1,2,3) LIMIT 1000
✅ Use proper pagination with cursor

❌ N+1 queries in application code
✅ Use JOIN or batch queries

❌ No indexes on foreign keys
✅ Always index foreign key columns

❌ Using OFFSET for pagination
✅ Use keyset/cursor pagination

❌ Functions on indexed columns in WHERE
✅ Rewrite to use index-friendly form

❌ Subquery when JOIN would work
✅ Often JOIN is more efficient
```

## Quick Reference

| Issue | Solution | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Slow WHERE | Add index on column | CREATE INDEX idx_... |
| Slow JOIN | Index join columns | CREATE INDEX idx_... |
| Slow ORDER BY | Index for ORDER BY | CREATE INDEX idx_... |
| Full table scan | Check plan, add index | EXPLAIN ANALYZE |
| N+1 query | Use JOIN or batch | - |
| Offset pagination | Use cursor/keyset | WHERE id > ? |
| Too many indexes | Monitor, remove unused | pg_stat_user_indexes |

## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
