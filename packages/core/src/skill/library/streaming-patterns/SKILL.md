# Streaming Architecture Patterns

**Focus:** Real-time processing, event streaming, windowing

## 1. Message Broker Selection

```
When to use what:
├── Kafka (Confluent, AWS MSK)
│   ├── High throughput, durable
│   ├── Exact ordering within partition
│   └── Large scale (>10K events/sec)
│
├── AWS Kinesis
│   ├── Managed, no ops
│   ├── Simpler than Kafka
│   └── Good for AWS-native
│
├── Google Pub/Sub
│   ├── GCP-native, global
│   └── Managed, auto-scaling
│   └── At-least-once delivery
│
├── RabbitMQ
│   ├── Complex routing (topics, exchanges)
│   └── Lower throughput OK
│   └── Not for high-scale streaming
│
└── Redis Streams
    └── Low latency, small scale
    └── Consumer groups supported
```

---

## 2. Kafka Patterns

```
Kafka Patterns:
├── Topic Design
│   ├── By entity (orders, users)
│   ├── By purpose (raw, processed)
│   └── Partition by customer_id or user_id
│
├── Consumer Groups
│   ├── Multiple consumers share partitions
│   └── Scale horizontally
│   └── Same group = coordinated consumption
│
├── Exactly-once Semantics
│   ├── Idempotent producer (enable.idempotence)
│   ├── Transactional producer + consumer
│   └── Use for critical data
│
├── Partition Strategy
│   ├── Key-based for ordering
│   └── Round-robin for distribution
│
└── Retention
    └── 7 days default, adjust by use case
    └── Compact for key-value data
```

---

## 3. Stream Processing Patterns

```
Processing Patterns:
├── Stateless
│   ├── Map/filter each event
│   ├── No state between events
│   └── Example: filter, enrich, transform
│
├── Stateful
│   ├── Aggregations over windows
│   └── Example: count, sum, running total
│   └── Need state store
│
├── Windowing
│   ├── Tumbling (fixed, non-overlapping)
│   ├── Sliding (overlapping)
│   └── Session (activity-based)
│
├── Joins
│   ├── Stream-stream (time-bounded)
│   ├── Stream-table (lookup)
│   └── Table-table (maintain materialized view)
│
└── Exactly-once end-to-end
    └── Source (CDC) → Kafka → Sink (DB)
    └── Transactional producers/consumers
```

---

## 4. Event Time vs Processing Time

```
Time Handling:
├── Event Time (when it happened)
│   └── Timestamp in the event itself
│   └── Watermark for late data
│
├── Processing Time (when processed)
│   └── Simpler, no late data
│   └── But loses temporal context
│
└── Handling Late Data
    ├── Allow lateness (within window)
    └── Watermark: "no more events after X"
    └── Drop or side-output late events

Example:
```sql
SELECT window_start, count(*)
FROM TUMBLE(event_time, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE)
GROUP BY window_start
```
```

---

## 5. Streaming Integrations

```
Common Integrations:
├── CDC to Kafka
│   ├── Debezium for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
│   └── Change stream → Kafka topic
│
├── Kafka to Data Lake
│   ├── Kafka Connect to S3/GCS (CSV, Parquet)
│   └── Schema registry for compatibility
│
├── Kafka to Database
│   ├── Kafka Connect for JDBC sinks
│   └── ksqlDB for materialized views
│
└── Kafka to Real-time
    └── Kafka Streams for stream processing
    └── Flink for complex analytics
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Partition by key** - For ordering guarantee
2. **Exactly-once** - Only when needed (costly)
3. **Watermarks** - Handle late data gracefully
4. **Idempotent consumers** - Handle duplicate messages
5. **Backpressure** - Handle slow consumers with scaling

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ No partitioning strategy — random distribution
✅ Partition by business key (user_id, order_id)

❌ Too many topics — too many consumers to manage
✅ Few broad topics > many narrow topics

❌ No schema evolution — breaking changes in producers
✅ Schema registry, backward compatibility

❌ Consumer lag not monitored — falling behind silently
✅ Monitor consumer lag, alert on backlog

❌ Synchronous processing — blocks entire stream
✅ Async processing, handle backpressure
```

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Implementation | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Pub/Sub | Event streaming | Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub |
| Exactly-once | Idempotent + transaction | Kafka |
| Windowing | Time-based aggregation | Flink, ksqlDB |
| CDC | Change data capture | Debezium |
| Stream-table | Lookup materialized view | ksqlDB |
| Enrichment | Join stream with database | Kafka Streams |

## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
