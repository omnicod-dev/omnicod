# Testing Architecture Patterns

**Tools:** Vitest, RTL, Playwright | **Focus:** TDD, coverage, mocking

## 1. TDD Workflow

```
Red-Green-Refactor:
1. Write failing test (describe expected behavior)
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor (improve without breaking)

When to write tests:
├── Before code (TDD) - preferred for new features
├── After code (debugging) - for fixing bugs
└── Before refactoring - ensure behavior preserved
```

**Test-first benefits:**
- Better API design (tests are first consumer)
- Clearer requirements (must express in test)
- Confidence to refactor

---

## 2. Test Selection Strategy

```
What to test:
├── Business logic - core functionality
├── User interactions - forms, buttons
├── Edge cases - empty, null, max values
├── Error states - network failure, validation
└── Critical paths - checkout, login

What NOT to test:
├── Implementation details - can change
├── Third-party code - assume works
├── Simple getters/setters - no logic
└── Generated code - no logic
```

**Coverage target:**
- 80% overall (functionality)
- 100% critical paths (checkout, auth)
- Ignore: UI details, styles

---

## 3. Test Type Selection

```
Unit tests:
├── Test single function/method
├── Mock all external dependencies
├── Fast, isolated
└── Use for: utilities, helpers, algorithms

Integration tests:
├── Test multiple units together
├── Real DB or test DB
├── Use for: API endpoints, DB operations
└── Slower, more realistic

E2E tests:
├── Test full user flow
├── Real browser
├── Use for: critical paths only (login, checkout)
└── Slowest, most realistic
```

---

## 4. Mock Strategy

```
When to mock:
├── External services (API, DB)
├── Slow operations (network, file I/O)
├── Hard to reproduce (timeouts, errors)
└── Third-party libraries

When NOT to mock:
├── Business logic - test real implementation
├── Simple functions - just test directly
├── What you're testing - test real, mock dependencies
```

**Mock location:**
- Per test (flexible, verbose)
- Before all (setup, cleaner)
- Factory function (reusable)

---

## 5. Test Structure

```
AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert):
├── Arrange: set up data, mocks
├── Act: call function/method
└── Assert: check expected behavior

Test organization:
├── Describe: feature/component being tested
├── It: specific behavior
├── Before/after: setup/teardown
└── Each: per-test setup
```

---

## 6. React Component Testing Strategy

```
What to test:
├── User interactions: clicks, forms, navigation
├── Conditional rendering: states, errors, loading
├── Props: different inputs, different outputs
└── Accessibility: keyboard, screen reader

What NOT to test:
├── Implementation details (state, refs)
├── Styles (except functional)
└── Child components (test them separately)
```

**Testing Library approach:**
- Query by role (button, heading)
- Query by label (form fields)
- Fire events, not methods
- Assert behavior, not internals

---

## 7. E2E Test Selection

```
When to write E2E:
├── Critical user flows
├── Multi-page interactions
└── Browser-specific behavior

What to test:
├── Login → dashboard
├── Add to cart → checkout → confirmation
├── Search → filter → results
└── Error recovery flows

What NOT to test:
├── Every page
├── Edge cases (unit tests cover)
├── Performance (separate suite)
└── Visual details (visual regression tests)
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **TDD first** - Write test before code
2. **Test behavior** - Not implementation
3. **Mock external** - Test internal logic
4. **80% coverage** - Focus critical paths
5. **E2E sparingly** - Only critical flows

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Testing implementation details (internals, private methods)
✅ Test behavior from the user's perspective — what it does, not how

❌ Mocking everything, including the thing under test
✅ Mock only external boundaries (DB, HTTP, clock); test real logic

❌ Single test file with 200 test cases — slow, hard to navigate
✅ Co-locate tests with feature; one file per module

❌ Tests that pass individually but fail in CI (global state leak)
✅ Reset all shared state in beforeEach/afterEach

❌ 0% E2E tests relying only on unit tests
✅ Testing trophy: many unit, some integration, few critical E2E
```

## Quick Reference

| Test type | Tool | What to test |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Vitest / Jest | Pure functions, hooks |
| Component | Testing Library | User interactions |
| Integration | Supertest | API routes |
| E2E | Playwright | Critical user journeys |
| Visual | Chromatic | UI regression |
| Performance | Lighthouse CI | CWV thresholds |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
