# WebSocket Patterns

**Focus:** Real-time bidirectional communication

---

## 1. Connection Lifecycle

```
Connection states:

├── Connecting
│   └── Handshake in progress
│   └── After: HTTP upgrade request
│   └── Timeout: 10-30 seconds
│
├── Connected
│   └── Full-duplex channel open
│   └── Keep-alive: ping/pong every 30s
│   └── Bi-directional messaging
│
├── Closing
│   └── Graceful shutdown initiated
│   └── Code 1000 (normal) or error codes
│   └── Clean-up: release resources
│
└── Disconnected
    └── Connection lost
    └── Trigger reconnection
```

---

## 2. Reconnection Strategy

```
When reconnect:

├── Immediate retry
    └── First attempt after disconnect
    └── 0-1 second delay
│
├── Exponential backoff
    └── Delay: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 30s (max)
    └── Jitter: random +/- 1 second
    └── Reset on successful connection
│
├── Max retries
    └── After 5-10 failures, stop
    └── Notify user: "connection lost"
    └── Offer manual reconnect button
│
└── Always include
    └── Random jitter (prevent thundering herd)
    └── Backoff on server errors
    └── Immediate retry on network change
```

---

## 3. Rooms and Channels

```
When to use rooms:

├── User-specific
│   └── Private messages
│   └── Per-user notification stream
│   └── Join room: user:{userId}
│
├── Group-based
│   └── Team chat, group conversations
│   └── Join room: team:{teamId}
│   └── Broadcast to group
│
├── Broadcast
│   └── All connected clients
│   └── Announcements, system updates
│   └── No room needed, send to all
│
└── Topic-based (pub/sub)
    └── Multiple interests per user
    └── Subscribe: notifications, updates, alerts
    └── Pattern: MQTT-style routing
```

---

## 4. Message Patterns

```
Message types:

├── Client → Server
│   ├── ACTION: user performed action
│   ├── SUBSCRIBE: join room/channel
│   ├── UNSUBSCRIBE: leave room/channel
│   └── PING: keep-alive (optional)
│
└── Server → Client
    ├── EVENT: real-time update
    ├── BROADCAST: room-wide message
    ├── ACK: confirm message received
    └── PONG: keep-alive response
```

```
Protocol design:
├── Include message type/enum
├── Include payload (JSON)
├── Include timestamp (server-side)
├── Include correlation ID (request/response)
└── Include message ID (for ACKs)
```

---

## 5. Scaling Considerations

```
Single server (start here):
├── In-memory connection storage
├── Works for < 10k concurrent connections
└── Simple, no external dependencies

Redis pub/sub (horizontal scaling):
├── Store connections in Redis
├── Route messages through Redis
├── Can scale to millions
├── Add: Redis adapter for Socket.io
└── Trade-off: latency increase

WebSocket gateway (production):
├── Dedicated WS servers
├── Route via load balancer
├── Sticky sessions required
└── Shared state via Redis
```

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Heartbeat** — Detect dead connections early
2. **Auto-reconnect** — Seamless recovery
3. **Graceful degradation** — Fallback to polling if needed
4. **Message queue** — Buffer during disconnect
5. **Rate limiting** — Prevent flooding

---

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ No reconnection logic — broken connection = dead client
✅ Exponential backoff reconnect with jitter

❌ Sending full state on every update
✅ Send diffs/patches; client reconciles

❌ No authentication on WebSocket upgrade
✅ Validate JWT/cookie on HTTP upgrade handshake

❌ Unlimited connections per user
✅ Enforce max connections per user; close old on new connect

❌ Ignoring WebSocket close codes
✅ Handle 1000 (normal), 1001 (going away), 4xxx (app errors)
```

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | Solution | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Reconnect | Exponential backoff | 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s... max 60s |
| Auth | Token in query or upgrade header | Not in URL for prod |
| Rooms | Map<roomId, Set<socket>> | Server-side routing |
| Broadcast | Iterate room sockets | Or Redis Pub/Sub for multi-node |
| Heartbeat | ping/pong interval | 30s; close if no pong |
| Compression | permessage-deflate | Header negotiation |


## 🌍 Universal Language Support
- **Turkish Native:** This skill natively supports Turkish. If the user prompt is in Turkish, all analysis, formatting, and output MUST be entirely in Turkish. You do not need explicit "write in Turkish" instructions.
