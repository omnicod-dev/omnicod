# OmniCod

**A terminal-native AI coding assistant built for the way developers actually work.**

```
❯ omnicod
```

OmniCod runs entirely in your terminal. No browser tabs, no Electron overhead, no clipboard
juggling between windows. You stay in the environment where you already write code, and the AI
meets you there — with full access to your files, shell, language servers, and running processes.

---

## Why OmniCod?

Most AI coding tools are built around a chat interface that happens to have a code block.
OmniCod is built around a **coding environment** that happens to have a chat interface.

**It understands your project before you say a word.**
OmniCod scans your repository on startup — framework, language, package manager, config files,
existing conventions — and injects that context into every request. You don't have to explain
that you're using Next.js with Tailwind and Drizzle. It already knows.

**It works with real tools, not simulated ones.**
Every file read, shell command, and code edit happens through a typed, permission-controlled
tool layer. Commands are classified as safe, warning, or dangerous before execution. Risky
executables run inside an isolated sandbox. You always know what's happening and why.

**It thinks in parallel, not in sequence.**
Long tasks — refactoring a module, writing a test suite, auditing security — are broken into
subtasks and distributed across a pool of specialized worker agents: code, review, test, docs,
performance, security, debug, analytics, explore. Results flow back into a shared context.

**It speaks your stack's language.**
218+ skills cover specific frameworks, tools, and patterns. A skill isn't a prompt template —
it's a structured context injection that shapes how the AI reasons about your particular
combination of technologies.

**It stays out of your way.**
The TUI is built on Ink (React for terminals). It renders cleanly, scrolls correctly, handles
wide output, and gets out of the way when you're not interacting with it. No flickering, no
full-screen takeovers.

**It exposes a local API.**
Every session is reachable over HTTP with bearer-token auth. Pipe output from scripts, drive
OmniCod from CI, or build your own tooling on top.

## LLM Robustness Layer

OmniCod works well even with weaker or cheaper models because reliability logic lives in the framework — not in the model.

### Pattern-Completion Mitigation

LLMs sometimes fill in code from training memory rather than from what's actually in the file. OmniCod fights this at three levels:

**A — Edit failure diagnosis**
When `edit` fails because `old_string` doesn't match, the error now explicitly tells the model it likely pattern-completed and must re-read the file before retrying. Weak models that guess content without reading are caught and redirected immediately.

**B — Re-read gating (10-call staleness window)**
Every file read or write is tracked with a call-index timestamp. When `edit` is called on a file that hasn't been read in the last 10 tool calls, the current file content is automatically injected into the result — without executing the edit. The model sees actual current content and can retry with a correct `old_string`.

**C — Symbol pre-verification**
Before a write or edit on a TypeScript/JavaScript file, named imports from local modules are extracted and verified. If the file exists but the named export doesn't, the write is blocked with a diagnostic message pointing to the missing symbol. Hallucinated function and type names are caught before they reach the filesystem.

### Additional Robustness Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Dual-path TypeScript verification** | `tsc --noEmit` runs automatically after every edit/write on typed files. TypeScript errors in the edited file are appended to the tool result so the model can self-correct without a separate check step. Results cached 8 seconds. |
| **Stuck detection** | A per-turn failure tracker detects when the same tool+error combination appears twice in a row. A `[SYSTEM]` warning is injected into the next result, forcing the model to change approach. |
| **Error analysis hints** | Every tool error is inspected by regex. ENOENT, module-not-found, TypeScript errors, port-in-use, permission denied, OOM — each pattern generates a one-line actionable hint appended to the error. |
| **Output summarization** | Tool outputs over 4 000 chars are automatically summarized before reaching the model. `grep` results: first 50 matches + file/count summary. General output: head 2 500 chars + tail 600 chars with an omission notice. |
| **Proactive file injection** | File paths mentioned in the user's message are resolved and injected into the system prompt before the model even calls `read`. The model starts with the relevant content already in context. |
| **Git context freshness** | For Anthropic providers, git status/branch/log is placed in a separate uncached system message block so it reflects the current state on every turn — never stale from the 5-minute prompt cache. |
| **Structured compaction** | Session summaries are required to output MODIFIED_FILES, DECISIONS, ERRORS, CURRENT_STATE, and NEXT_STEPS with verbatim file paths and error messages. Vague summaries that lose specific values are structurally prevented. |
| **Memory extraction on compaction** | Before context is compacted, memories (preferences, project facts, patterns) are extracted and stored in SQLite. They are re-injected into every future session without relying on the conversation history. |

## MCP Integration

OmniCod reads MCP server configuration from `.omnicod/mcp.json`, using the same format
as `claude_desktop_config.json`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

MCP tools appear alongside built-in tools and are subject to the same permission system.

---

## HTTP API

OmniCod exposes a REST/SSE API on `127.0.0.1:7777`. All endpoints except `/v1/health`
require bearer-token authentication.

```bash
# Read the auto-generated token
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.omnicod/server-token)

# Health check (no auth required)
curl http://localhost:7777/v1/health

# Create a session
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/v1/session \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-6"}'

# List sessions
curl http://localhost:7777/v1/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Send a message (SSE stream)
curl -N http://localhost:7777/v1/session/<id>/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"refactor the auth module"}'
```

The token is stored at `~/.omnicod/server-token` (mode 600) and regenerated if deleted.

---

## Configuration

OmniCod stores all configuration in `~/.omnicod/`:

```
~/.omnicod/
├── omnicod.db          # SQLite database (sessions, config, MCP servers)
├── server-token        # HTTP API bearer token (chmod 600)
└── todos.json          # Project-local task list (per working directory)
```

To set a default provider and model:

```bash
omnicod /config set default.provider anthropic
omnicod /config set default.model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

---

## Development

```bash
bun install              # install dependencies
bun run dev              # start in development mode (hot reload)
bun run test             # run all 145 tests
bun run typecheck        # TypeScript strict check (both packages)
bun run build            # compile to standalone binary → dist/omnicod
```
